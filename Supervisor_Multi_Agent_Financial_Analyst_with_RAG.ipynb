The company reported a significant downturn in key financial metrics, notably underperforming against analyst expectations for both earnings per share and revenue.

The company's operating income also declined by 56% year-over-year to $1.17 billion, reflecting increased operational costs and lower vehicle sales.

[...] Prior to the 13% jump after hours, Tesla shares were down more than 40% this year, reaching their lowest since January 2023, on concerns about weak deliveries, competition in China and the company's ongoing price cuts. Earlier this month, Tesla reported an 8.5% year-over-year decline in vehicle deliveries for the first quarter.\n",

            "\n",
            "**Financial Performance:**\n",
            "\n",
            "Tesla reported a GAAP net income of $1.1 billion and a GAAP operating income of $1.2 billion for Q1 2024.  Non-GAAP net income reached $1.5 billion. While these figures represent profitability, they represent a significant downturn compared to the previous year and analyst expectations.  Operating cash flow was a meager $0.2 billion, while free cash flow was negative $2.5 billion, primarily due to substantial capital expenditures ($2.8 billion, including $1 billion for AI infrastructure).  This negative free cash flow and the significant year-over-year decrease in operating cash flow (reported as a 90% decline by Web_Analyst) are significant concerns.  The company attributed the lower-than-expected performance to increased operational costs and lower vehicle sales.  Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) per unit decreased sequentially due to lower raw material costs, excluding factors like Cybertruck production and unscheduled downtime.\n",

            "\n",
            "Vehicle production was negatively impacted by several factors: the Red Sea conflict, an arson attack at Gigafactory Berlin, and the ramp-up of the updated Model 3 in Fremont.  These disruptions contributed to the lower-than-anticipated sales figures.\n",

            "**Key Risks:**\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "* **Global pressure on EV sales:**  The overall market for electric vehicles is facing headwinds, impacting Tesla's sales.\n",
            "* **Geopolitical instability (Red Sea conflict):** The ongoing conflict in the Red Sea region has disrupted supply chains and negatively impacted production.\n",
            "* **Production disruptions (Gigafactory Berlin arson):** The arson attack at Gigafactory Berlin further hampered production capacity.\n",
            "* **Production issues and future demand:** Concerns exist regarding Tesla's ability to meet future demand given the production challenges experienced in Q1 2024.\n",
            "* **Increased competition, particularly in China:**  The competitive landscape in the EV market, especially in China, is intensifying, posing a threat to Tesla's market share.\n",
            "* **Disappointing Q1 2024 deliveries and falling short of analyst expectations:**  The underperformance against analyst expectations highlights market concerns about Tesla's future growth trajectory.\n",

            "**Conclusion:**\n",
            "\n",
            "Tesla's Q1 2024 results show profitability but reveal significant challenges.  The company's heavy investment in future growth, coupled with operational setbacks and a challenging market environment, resulted in lower-than-expected financial performance and a negative free cash flow.  The identified risks highlight the need for effective mitigation strategies to ensure future success.\n"
